# The SOLID Design Principles

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

### states that each class has only one responsibility, and therefore has only one reason to change

in Example srp.cpp, suppose you decide to keep your journal, simply we have a class with a constructor and member function to add entries
now suppose you decide to make the journal persist by saving it in a file. if we do it as a member function this will be problematic because any change in the persistence approach( cloud instead of a file, ..etc) would require a lot of tiny changes in affected classes

"an architecture that leads you to have to do lots of tiny changes in lost of classes, whether related (as in a hierarchy) or not, is typically a code smell "

## Open Closed Principle (OCP)

### states that a type is open for extension but closed for modification.

In other words, want to provide certain filtering capabilities for a given set of products. example (ocp.cpp)

We make a filter say for color, but unfortunately, sometimes new requirements come in and ask us to implement filtering by size, or combination between size and color. So we jump back to the code and add a new member function to do that. this feels like duplication and may be problematic.

1. perhaps in a different compilation unit
2. recompiling something that already works and may have been shipped to clients

Why donâ€™t we just write a general method and take the filtering function as an argument? The open-Closed Principle states that a type is open for extension but closed for modification.
In other words, we want extensible filtering without having to modify it.

HOW?
we conceptually separate our filtering process into two parts

1. filter (a process that takes all items and returns some )
2. specification definition of a function that will apply to the data
